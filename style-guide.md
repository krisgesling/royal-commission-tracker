# Style Guide: The Unfinished Mandate

This guide outlines the core visual elements for "The Unfinished Mandate" website, ensuring a consistent and impactful aesthetic that conveys urgency, authority, and accountability.
1. Color Palette

The palette is designed to be strong and direct, using a mix of official tones and urgent accents.

    Primary Gradient (Urgency/Action):

        Red: #DC2626

        Orange: #EA580C

    Secondary Accent (Contrast/Depth):

        Deep Red: #991B1B

        Usage: For subtle shadows, borders, or text elements that need to stand out against lighter backgrounds without being overwhelming.

    Official Base (Authority/Seriousness):

        Dark Grey/Slate: #4A5568 (from logo base)

        Usage: For background elements of official-looking components, card backgrounds, or subtle UI elements that provide a sense of gravitas.

    Accent (Prestige/Highlight):

        Gold/Yellow: #FFD700

        Usage: Sparingly, for subtle highlights, borders on official elements (like the book outline in the logo), or key icon details.

    Text/Background Contrast:

        Light Text: #E2E8F0 (for dark backgrounds)

        Dark Background: #1A202C (primary site background)

        Mid-Tone Background: #2D3748 (for containers/cards)

        Usage: Ensure high contrast for readability.

    Status Indicators:

        "Fulfilled/Complete": A clear, strong Green (e.g., #16A34A)

        "Pending/Awaiting Action": A distinct Orange (e.g., #F59E0B)

        "Disregarded/Unmet": The primary Red (#DC2626)

2. Typography

The font choices balance official seriousness with impactful assertiveness.

    Headings & Official Text (e.g., "THE UNFINISHED", "UNMET"):

        Font Family: 'IBM Plex Sans'

        Weight: 700 (Bold)

        Style: Uppercase, strong, and clear. This font conveys authority and clarity, suitable for official statements and primary headings.

    Impactful Titles & Key Phrases (e.g., "MANDATE"):

        Font Family: 'Oswald'

        Weight: 700 (Bold)

        Style: Uppercase, condensed, and impactful. Use for elements that need to grab attention and convey a sense of urgency or finality.

        Letter Spacing: 0.05em for added visual weight.

    Body Text & General UI:

        Font Family: 'Inter' (or a similar clean, highly legible sans-serif)

        Weight: 400 (Regular) to 600 (Semi-Bold)

        Usage: For readability in longer paragraphs, detailed descriptions, and general interface labels.

3. UI Elements

Clean, modern, and purposeful.

    Cards & Containers:

        Rounded corners (e.g., border-radius: 0.75rem to 1rem).

        Subtle shadows (e.g., box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)).

        Backgrounds should generally be #2D3748 or a slightly lighter shade for depth against the main #1A202C body.

    Buttons:

        Gradient fills using the primary red-orange gradient.

        Rounded corners.

        Clear, bold text (using IBM Plex Sans or Oswald).

        Subtle hover effects (e.g., slight scale, darker gradient, or a subtle glow) to indicate interactivity.

    Forms & Inputs:

        Clean, minimalist design.

        Subtle borders, possibly with a focus state that highlights in gold or a light version of the primary gradient.

        Rounded corners.

4. Icons

Icons should be clear, concise, and communicate status or action without being overly decorative.

    "UNMET" Stamp: The visual motif from the logo (a rectangular bar with the "UNMET" text, in the red-orange gradient) can be adapted for smaller elements where a clear "unfulfilled" status needs to be shown.

    Stalled Line: The horizontal line used under "MANDATE" in the logo is a powerful, simple visual for "stalled" or "no progress."

    General Status Icons:

        Checkmark: For "fulfilled" or "implemented."

        Clock/Hourglass: For "pending" or "in progress."

        Cross/X: For "disregarded" or "denied."

        Styling: Keep these icons clean, using solid colors corresponding to the status palette (green, orange, red).

5. Tone & Messaging

The visual design should consistently reinforce the site's assertive and accountability-driven tone.

    Serious but Engaging: Professional enough to be taken seriously, but with a directness that engages users emotionally about the issue.

    Urgency: The red-orange gradient and bold typography should subtly convey a sense of urgency for action.

    Clarity: Information should be presented clearly and without ambiguity, reflecting the demand for transparency.

    Australian Context: While not overtly themed, the overall professionalism and directness should resonate with an Australian audience concerned with government accountability.
