# The Unfinished Mandate

**Tracking the implementation status of Australian Royal Commission recommendations**

The Unfinished Mandate is a comprehensive web platform that tracks recommendations from Australian Royal Commissions and government inquiries, providing transparent reporting on their implementation status. This platform serves as the definitive public ledger for holding governments accountable to the vital recommendations that shape policy and protect communities.

## üéØ The Problem

Australia invests substantial resources in Royal Commissions and inquiries, generating vital recommendations aimed at addressing systemic issues, protecting vulnerable communities, and improving public services. Yet, a significant number of these recommendations remain unimplemented, often gathering dust in bureaucratic silos.

This leads to continued harm and erosion of public confidence. The "mandate for change" often remains tragically unfulfilled, while new governments assume office claiming fresh mandates without addressing the unfinished business of the past.

## üîç Platform Features

### Comprehensive Tracking
A robust database detailing recommendations from key Australian inquiries, including their current status from acceptance to implementation.

### Transparent Reporting  
Intuitive visualizations and clear data presentations that highlight implementation gaps and areas of concern.

### Actionable Insights
Easily discover and share specific unimplemented recommendations, fostering public advocacy and direct engagement with decision-makers.

### Key Functionality
- **Browse Commission Reports**: View detailed information about Royal Commissions and their recommendations
- **Discover Unimplemented Recommendations**: Use the random discovery feature to explore unfulfilled mandates
- **Implementation Status Tracking**: Clear indicators showing acceptance and implementation status
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, accessible design prioritizing clarity and credibility
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## üé® Design Philosophy

The Unfinished Mandate adopts a professional, authoritative design approach that emphasizes clarity and credibility:
### Design Principles

- **üéØ Clarity Over Complexity**: Every design decision prioritizes user understanding. Complex political information becomes accessible without losing nuance.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Authority Through Evidence**: Visual hierarchy and typography establish credibility. Data speaks louder than opinion.
- **üî• Urgency Without Panic**: Design creates momentum for action while maintaining rational, informed discourse.
- **üåà Optimism in Accountability**: Colorful elements represent the vibrant democracy we're fighting for, not just the problems we're solving.

## üé® Visual Identity

The platform uses a professional design system featuring:
- **Typography**: Inter for interface elements and Crimson Text for content
- **Color Palette**: Navy primary (#2c3e50) with red accents (#e74c3c)
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for implementation status
- **Clean Layout**: Focused on readability and accessibility

## üìä Data Structure

Each commission is stored as a JSON file in the `public/` directory. The platform supports both legacy flat structures and new categorized formats:

### New Categorized Format
```json
{
  "name": "Commission Name",
  "summary": "Brief overview of the commission's purpose",
  "findings": "Key findings from the inquiry",
  "year": 2023,
  "totalRecommendations": 25,
  "implementationStatus": {
    "fullyImplemented": 5,
    "partiallyImplemented": 8,
    "notImplemented": 10,
    "notAccepted": 2
  },
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Category Name",
      "description": "Category description",
      "recommendations": [
        {

          "recommendation": "The recommendation text",
          "notes": "Implementation notes or details",
          "accepted": true,
          "implemented": "partial"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "keyOutcomes": ["Outcome 1", "Outcome 2"],
  "ongoingChallenges": ["Challenge 1", "Challenge 2"]
}
```

### Legacy Format
